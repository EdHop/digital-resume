    <h2>Climbing</h2>
    <p>As anyone who climbs themselves probabvly knows, if you have climbing listed as a hobby, there is little time left in life to have anything else listed here. Rock climbing, to be specific, is unbelievable fun. It can be extremely sociable, with sessions indoors being a great place to spend some time with friends. However, a large appeal of the sport is the outdoor possibilities - at least to me it's a big draw. To be able to climb in beaustiful locations, be it sea cliffs in the Enlgish Lake Distrcit or Donner Lake in California, is a major attraction of the sport to me.</p>
